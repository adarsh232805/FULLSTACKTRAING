        <p>
            Once upon a time, in a lush green forest, lived a clever fox named Ruby. She loved exploring and solving puzzles. One sunny morning, Ruby found a mysterious box under an old oak tree. Using her wit, she unlocked the box and discovered a treasure map! With excitement, Ruby followed the clues and shared the treasure with all her forest friends. From that day, Ruby became the hero of the forest, known for her cleverness and kindness.
